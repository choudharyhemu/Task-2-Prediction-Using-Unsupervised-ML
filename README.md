# Task-2-Prediction-Using-Unsupervised-ML
This is my second task during my internship in Data Science &amp; Business Analytics at The Sparks Foundation where the problem statement is to predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. In this task, I used python with scikit learn library from where I  imported kMeans for doing k-means clustering. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
